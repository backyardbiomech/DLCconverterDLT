    "## Example analysis notebook\n",
    "Just some example code to automate analysis on all files in a folder using tools in this repo.\n",
    "The example script below is written assuming you have two cameras, with all videos in the same folder. Videos from one camera start with `cam1` and videos from the other start with `cam2`, with exactly the same remaining file names.\n",
    "That folder should also contain the `DLTcoefs.csv` file, and must include `DLTcoefs` in the file name.\n",
    "As written, the second code cell runs `deeplabcut.analyze_videos` on all videos in that folder. If they are already analyzed, that step will be skipped (or you can comment out that line)\n",
    "It will also create labeled videos for each video.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these files are not (yet) pip installable:\n",
    "1. Clone the github repo to a folder on your computer. DLC should be installed on the computer.\n",
    "2. Run the notebook in jupyter using the python kernel in your DLC env.\n",
    "3. Change the entries in the next cell.\n",
    "4. Run both code cells.\n",
    "5. Enjoy the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please cite the Argus paper if you use this code because this depends heavily on that repository."
